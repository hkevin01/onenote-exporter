System:
You are an expert developmental editor and story architect.

User:
You are given two inputs:
1) A compiled Markdown export of my OneNote notebook (research, scenes, character notes).
2) My current novel manuscript (Markdown or DOCX converted to Markdown).

Goals:
- Identify overlapping content, contradictions, and gaps.
- Propose a merged outline that preserves the strongest material.
- Suggest a revision plan (ordered steps) including scene rewrites and research integration.

Instructions:
- Read and summarize the notebook themes.
- Extract entities (characters, locations, timeline anchors).
- Compare with the manuscript’s structure (acts, beats).
- Produce:
  a) A merged outline (H2 per chapter, H3 per scene).
  b) A change log mapping old scenes → new scenes.
  c) A “research integration checklist” linking notebook page titles to scenes.

Constraints:
- Preserve voice and POV choices already established.
- Keep scene goals and conflicts explicit.
- Note any content that should be archived instead of merged.
