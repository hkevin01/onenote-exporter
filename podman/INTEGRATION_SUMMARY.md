# Podman Integration Summary

## What's Been Added

✅ **Complete Podman Support**: Full alternative to Docker with identical functionality
✅ **Cross-Platform Scripts**: Linux/macOS (`setup-podman.sh`) and Windows (`setup-podman.bat`)
✅ **Intelligent Detection**: Automatically detects and uses available compose tools
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed README with installation, usage, and troubleshooting
✅ **Compatibility Layer**: Works with both podman-compose and docker-compose

## Files Added

- `podman/podman-compose.yml` - Podman compose configuration
- `podman/setup-podman.sh` - Unix setup script with dependency checking
- `podman/setup-podman.bat` - Windows setup script with error handling
- `podman/README.md` - Complete documentation and troubleshooting guide

## Key Features

### Security Benefits
- **Rootless containers**: No root privileges required
- **No daemon**: No background service running as root
- **Lower attack surface**: Reduced security risks

### Compatibility
- **Drop-in replacement**: Uses same commands as Docker
- **Compose support**: Works with podman-compose or docker-compose
- **Same functionality**: Identical export capabilities

### Platform Support
- **Linux**: Native support with rootless mode
- **macOS**: Via podman machine (VM-based)
- **Windows**: Via podman machine with WSL2

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Setup (one-time)
./podman/setup-podman.sh

# List notebooks
podman-compose -f podman/podman-compose.yml run --rm onenote-exporter --list

# Export notebook
podman-compose -f podman/podman-compose.yml run --rm onenote-exporter \
  --notebook "My Notes" --merge --formats md,docx
```

## Integration Points

### Main README Updates
- Added container runtime options section
- Updated quick start with both Docker and Podman choices
- Emphasized flexibility and choice

### QUICKSTART.md Updates
- Added Podman setup commands
- Provided both Docker and Podman usage examples
- Maintained simplicity while offering options

### Documentation
- Comprehensive troubleshooting for common Podman issues
- Platform-specific installation instructions
- Performance and security comparisons

## Benefits Delivered

✅ **Zero-dependency setup**: Only requires Podman (no Python, deps, or complex setup)
✅ **Cross-platform**: Works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux
✅ **Foolproof setup**: Single script handles all initialization
✅ **Persistent data**: Output and cache directories automatically preserved
✅ **Clear instructions**: Quick start guide gets users running in minutes
✅ **Error prevention**: Template files and defaults prevent common mistakes
✅ **Security focused**: Rootless containers for enhanced security
✅ **Resource efficient**: Lower memory and CPU usage than Docker

The project now supports both Docker and Podman as first-class container runtimes, giving users choice based on their security, infrastructure, and preference requirements.
